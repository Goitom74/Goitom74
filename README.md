As a data analyst transitioning from an agricultural and environmental research background, I provide both domain knowledge and analytical expertise. The tools and skills I use to drive data-driven insights include:

**Data Analysis and Visualization**                                                                                                                                                                                    

Tableau - Interactive dashboards and KPI tracking

Microsoft Excel - Pivot tables, data cleaning, Advanced formulas

**Data Managment and Querying**

SQL(MySQL) - Joins, aggregations, subqueries, data transformation

**Domain Experience**

Environmental and agricultural data (soil, water, crop data)

Public sector data (such as income, demogaphics, debt, transportation)

Customer behaviour (such as churn, call center performance)

**Other tools**

Github - Project collaboration
